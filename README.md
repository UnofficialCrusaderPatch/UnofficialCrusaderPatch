# Unofficial Crusader Patch  [![UCP_Official](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/426318193603117057/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/N4UVjZBRXU)


## About the UCP

This project is an unofficial patcher for [Firefly Studio's](https://fireflyworlds.com/) game [Stronghold Crusader 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40970/Stronghold_Crusader_HD/). It features a framework to apply community bug-fixes, rebalancing unit stats, and quality-of-life changes, as well as to provide new content such as maps 
and AI. To apply this patch you need to have Stronghold Crusader installed, the setup does not include any files created by FireFly Studios, but instead edits them or adds community-made files. Further information can be found on our official [website](https://unofficialcrusaderpatch.github.io/).

## Installation

To install the patch we recommend you download the latest [release](https://github.com/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases).

1. Unzip it to a folder of choice and run the GUI.
2. In the GUI, select your Stronghold Crusader 1 game folder (making a copy of this folder to a different location is recommended).
3. Then, proceed with installing the patching materials (UCP3 zip).
4. To get you started, it is recommended to select the UCP2-legacy plugin which configures recommended settings.
5. Launch the game by launching the original .exe file or launch it from the GUI itself.
6. Enjoy!

The patch should work for most crusader versions, but only v1.41 and v1.41.1 (Extreme) are officially supported. If you encounter an error using a different version, you can upgrade to 1.41 for free using Fireflyâ€™s [Crusader HD Patch](http://www.strongholdcrusaderhd.com/patch.html).

#### Glossary of important terms
