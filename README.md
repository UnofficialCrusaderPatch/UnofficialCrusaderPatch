# Unofficial Crusader Patch 3  [![UCP_Official](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/426318193603117057/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/N4UVjZBRXU)
**UCP 3.0 has been released! Get it [here](https://github.com/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases)!** :tada:

Are you looking for the previous version of the patch (UCP2)? That repo has moved to [here](https://github.com/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/UnofficialCrusaderPatch2/). Don't worry, we are still reading and considering all issues reported with the previous version.

## About the UCP

This project is an unofficial patcher for [Firefly Studio's](https://fireflyworlds.com/) game [Stronghold Crusader 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40970/Stronghold_Crusader_HD/). It features a framework to apply community bug-fixes, rebalancing unit stats, and quality-of-life changes, as well as to provide new content such as maps 
and AI. To apply this patch you need to have Stronghold Crusader installed, the setup does not include any files created by FireFly Studios, but instead edits them or adds community-made files. Further information can be found on our official [website](https://unofficialcrusaderpatch.github.io/).

## Installation

To install the patch we recommend you download the [GUI](https://github.com/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases).

1. Run the GUI.
2. In the GUI, select your Stronghold Crusader 1 game folder.
3. Then, press the button to install the latest patching materials to this game folder.
4. To get you started, it is recommended to select the UCP2-legacy-defaults plugin which configures recommended settings you might be familiar with from UCP 2.
5. Hit the Apply button to save the configuration to disk.
6. Launch the game by going to the Launch tab and clicking an icon. You can also launch the game outside of the GUI by launching the original .exe file, or launch it via Steam.
7. Enjoy!

The patch should work for most crusader versions, but only v1.41 and v1.41.1 (Extreme) are officially supported. If you encounter an error using a different version, you can upgrade to 1.41 for free using Fireflyâ€™s [Crusader HD Patch](http://www.strongholdcrusaderhd.com/patch.html) or get the game on Steam.

#### Glossary of important terms
