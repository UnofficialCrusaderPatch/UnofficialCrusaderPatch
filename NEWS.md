Our UCP Discord was invaded and attacked by a malicious Discord user. 

We are in contact with Discord support services to get our server back.

We will place a new news message here when we have a new server set up for you.

In the meantime, you can join the old server on which we will also notify you of a new server.

A new version of the GUI has been released!

It features a "News" section where we can update you on new content, and new versions.

It also fixes a major bug that was present which reordered extensions in the active extensions list whenever an extension was activated.
This should now not happen anymore. Note that extensions higher in the list can override the configuration of extensions lower in the list.
