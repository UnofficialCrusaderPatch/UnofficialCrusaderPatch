# ⚔️ Announcing the Ascension AI Tournament 2025! 🏆
[meta]: <> (
timestamp: 2025-08-06
category: community
)

Modders, the ultimate challenge in AI creativity and strategy is here! We are thrilled to announce the **Ascension AI Tournament 2025**, and initial submissions are now open!

The goal is not just to create the most powerful AI, but to bring unique characters to life that result in fun, strategic, and memorable matches.

Here’s how to get started:

1.  **Install the Official Plugin:** Head to the UCP Store and install the new **Ascension AI Tournament Plugin**. This is **required** for testing your AI against the tournament’s unique balance and starting conditions. You can read the full ruleset in the plugin's description or directly on the **[Official Tournament GitHub](https://github.com/Krarilotus/Ascension-AI-Tournament/blob/main/locale/description-en.md)**.

2.  **Meet the First Deadline:** To enter the competition, you must submit a **fully-functioning AI** by the initial deadline of **August 20th, 2025**. This will secure your spot to participate.

**Important:** The first submission is not the final one! After securing your spot, you can continue to refine, tweak, and perfect your AI. Final adjustments will be allowed right up until the tournament's opening round begins (final lock-in date to be announced).

Furthermore, we are also looking for community members to help with organization, casting, and statistics. If you'd like to get involved, please contact us on Discord!

We can't wait to see the unique characters you bring to the battlefield! Happy modding!

# UCP Team is not working on a patch for the DE
[meta]: <> (
timestamp: 2025-02-27
category: community
)

Based on the Demo, we conclude that creating a UCP for the DE would mean we have to start over, almost from scratch. We can't develop and test our mods effectively due to technical reasons and the game files we want to mod are much more inaccessible in the DE. We are therefore not developing a UCP for the DE as it stands.

We have reached out to Firefly but as you may know, there will be no collaboration between Firefly and the UCP Team regarding the DE. Firefly states they are committed to make making mods as easy as possible, and while that may be true for the full release, currently the opposite is true for us in the Demo.

We will have to wait and see to what extent making mods for the full release of the DE is feasible. Thus, we are currently not working on a UCP patch for the DE, and if the current situation stays the same in the full release, there will no be UCP for the Definitive Edition.
